	<main>
		
		<!-- Webpage contains an article.
			<article> encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page
			(e.g., a single blog post).
			Another element I haven't used but coold be here is:
			<section> is similar to <article>, but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page that
			constitutes one single piece of functionality (e.g., a mini map, or a set of article headlines and
			summaries), or a theme.
				It's considered best practice to begin each section with a heading; also note that you can break
				<article>s up into different <section>s, or <section>s up into different <article>s,
				depending on the context.
			But I'll find a use for section when appropriate.
